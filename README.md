# DoctorSchedulerApp is a java application that helps a doctor with his appointments.
You can add an appointment from Monday to Friday starting from today's date between 10:00 to 18:00.
Warning:
It only holds up to 100 appointments.
Attention:
This application needs to use JXDATEPICKER.jar too , because it has been used as a date selector for new appointments.
